Search Modes
Images positioned at the selected area are detected regardless of how they were embedded in the page. The extension also supports searching with images from your device, images from private sites, and captured areas of the page.

A handful of search modes are offered that serve different use cases. The search mode can be set independently for the context menu and the browser toolbar from the extension's options.

Select URL: select an image on the page and search with the image URL. This is the default search mode.
Select image: select an image on the page and search with the image file. This search mode is preferred for sites which do not allow the direct linking of images, such as private sites.
Capture: search with a captured area of the page.
Browse: search with an image from your device. Pasting images from the clipboard is also supported.
URL: search with an image URL.
